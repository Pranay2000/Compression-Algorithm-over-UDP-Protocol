# Compression Algorithm and secure transmission over UDP protocol <img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/cdaa3bfc074058fe11e9fd6dad9ae3f419359372.svg" align="right" width="200" height="200"/>

Developed an architecture to compress files, using Huffman compression Algorithm and using secure transmission over UDP Protocol. The main objectives are:
- To establish a connection between CLIENT and SERVER using socket programming.
- To implement compression algorithm to compress the text file.
- To implement de-compression algorithm to de-compress the text file.
- To calculate the compression ratio, and space saving percentage.

## Client Server Architecture (CSA)
Client/server architecture is a computing model in which multiple components work in strictly defined roles to communicate. The server hosts, delivers and manages most of the resources and services to be consumed by the client

Client/server architecture works when the client computer sends a resource or process request to the server over the network connection, which is then processed and delivered to the client.

### Socket Programming
A socket programming is a way to establish a connection between a client and a server.It is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. One socket (node) listens on a particular port at an IP, while other socket reaches out to the other in order to form a connection.
