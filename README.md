# Compression Algorithm and secure transmission over UDP protocol

Developed an architecture to compress files, using Huffman compression Algorithm and using secure<img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/cdaa3bfc074058fe11e9fd6dad9ae3f419359372.svg" align="right" width="200" height="200"/><br>
transmission over UDP Protocol. The main objectives are:
- To establish a connection between CLIENT and SERVER using socket programming.
- To implement compression algorithm to compress the text file.
- To implement de-compression algorithm to de-compress the text file.
- To calculate the compression ratio, and space saving percentage.

## Socket Programming
A socket programming is a way to establish a connection between a client and a server.It is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate
with each other. One socket (node) listens on a particular port at an IP, while other socket reaches out to the other in order to form a connection.
